        <h4>A Journey Through Time: The Evolution of Calculators</h4>

        Calculators have come a long way since their inception, revolutionizing
        the way we perform mathematical computations. The history of calculators
        dates back to ancient times when abacuses were used for basic arithmetic operations.
        However, it was not until the 17th century that mechanical calculators,
        such as the Pascaline and the Leibniz Wheel, emerged. The fascinating journey of
        calculators showcases the continuous pursuit of efficiency and convenience
        in mathematical calculations, empowering
        individuals across various fields and shaping the course of technological advancement.
